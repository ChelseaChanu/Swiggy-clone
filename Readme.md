## Note on CORS Issues

Due to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issues with the API used in this project, you may encounter errors when trying to access the application. To work around these issues, please follow the step:

**Install a CORS Extension for Google Chrome**

   You can use a Google Chrome extension to bypass CORS restrictions. One popular extension is [CORS Allow](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf?hl=en).
